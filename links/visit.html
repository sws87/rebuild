In addition, Rebuild currently hosts public tours on the last Saturday of every month. Tour space is limited and subject to change based on availability. Please reserve a space via our Public Tour Reservation Form in advance to guarantee admission.<br><br>

Walking tours cover a distance of approximately one mile - two miles if tours include Black Cinema House. Please note that many of our spaces are housed within repurposed buildings and may not be accesible to all visitors. The Art Center at Dorchester Art + Housing Collaborative is currently our only fully accessible site.<br><br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Group Tours</span><br><br>

Private tours can be arranged for groups of 10-30 people. The suggested donation for all group tours is $250. These donations directly support our capacity to continue hosting public programs. Due to the intimate space of many of our buildings, tours are limited to 30 participants. To inquire about scheduling a private tour for your group, please fill out our Group Tour Request Form. We require four weeks notice for group tours.<br><br><br>
                
                <span class="bold">Directions</span><br><br>
Tours begin at the Listening House, 6918 S. Dorchester Ave. On street parking is available in front of all our buildings. The closest public transportation options include:
Metra: Stony Island Station (on 71st St.)
CTA Train: Red line to 69th St. Station, then Bus 71 to 71st St. & Dorchester Ave.
CTA Bus: Buses #28, J14, 67 and 6 depart from various points along Stony Island Ave.<br><br><br>

<span class="bold">What days of the week are private tours available?</span><br><br>

Tours can be arranged Monday-Friday, between 9 am – 5 pm. Weekend tours often compete with our existing programming and must be arranged on a case by case basis.<br><br><br>

<span class="bold">How much time should I expect the tour to take?</span><br><br>

Tours last approximately one hour. Depending on weather, expect to walk from one site to another, approximately one mile, round trip (two miles if including Black Cinema House). Each private tour can be customized to include the sites of most interest to your group.<br><br><br>

<span class="bold">Will we have access to Rebuild’s archival collections?</span><br><br>

                    We are excited to be in the process of making our archival collections much more accessible by preparing their move to a permanent home at the Stony Island Arts Bank – set to open October 2015. At that time we will be launching our new residency program inviting artistic and scholarly proposals for engaging the collections. Meanwhile, access to the collections is by appointment only. We are happy to make arrangements for you to visit the collection, Monday – Friday, 9am -5pm.</p><br><br><br>
